# VSCode-Machine-Learning-API

## This is the subsystem of Data Analysis. Basic operations such as Time-Series Analysis and Visualization are featured primarily in the MATLAB platform. At research, this subsystem extends its ability to performing data analysis into Optimization and Machine Learning. Since the core of our work works with data of consumption and generation of power in time series format, the hardware also enables the ability to collect sensor data in terms of irradiation from sunlight. In supervised learning definition, this can be represented as a feature input in Machine Learning context with generation and consumption of power as observation variables y, while exploring methods such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Time-Series Forecasting to forecast future events denoting the predicted consumption and generation of power in the system. The most effective method is Time-Series Forecasting that leverages ARIMA that integrates to original plan  to  dealing with time-series data involving consumption and generation,  Time-Series Forecasting and Machine Learning methods not limiting to regression,
